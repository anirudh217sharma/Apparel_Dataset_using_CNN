The dataset consist of 11385 images and includes next categories:

black_dress: 450
black_pants: 871
black_shirt: 715
black_shoes: 766
black_shorts: 328
blue_dress: 502
blue_pants: 798
blue_shirt: 741
blue_shoes: 523
blue_shorts: 299
brown_pants: 311
brown_shoes: 464
brown_shorts: 40
green_pants: 227
green_shirt: 230
green_shoes: 455
green_shorts: 135
red_dress: 800
red_pants: 308
red_shoes: 610
white_dress: 818
white_pants: 274
white_shoes: 600
white_shorts: 120

I was able to achive an accuracy of 88.14 % for 24 classes. 

NOTE : If you sub divide the classes into shoes , shirts etc there would only be 5 classes and the accuracy might improve significantly. In case any one wants to add to this or can improve it further , I would love to interact. 
Tensorflow is primarily used for this project
